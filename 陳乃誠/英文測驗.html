<h1>English Reading Test: Costa Serena Cruise Update</h1>
<p>Read the following passage and answer the questions below:</p>

<div id="passage" style="background-color: #e6f3ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <p>July 24, 2024 Dear Guest, While we are looking forward to welcoming you on board Costa Serena, we must take this time to provide you with an update about an important issue regarding your originally planned sailing schedule. As part of a continuous monitoring activity of the weather conditions and their possible developments along the route and at different destinations, we acknowledged about the development trajectory of typhoon GAEMI, which, according to the meteo-marine forecasts, is expected to head towards Keelung, Taiwan on 25th July, with sustained winds and gusts. Such a situation will not allow us to safely carry out the operations as we originally planned. For this reason, by focusing first on the safety of navigation and port operations, while preserving your serene and safe cruise holiday experience, we are forced to cancel the operation on the date of July 25. On another hand, as we understand the value of your long-awaited holiday while placing our utmost attention on the safety of operations, we are actively exploring the possible alternative itinerary for the sailing from 25-28, July, while continuously monitoring the development of the Typhoon. But as we well understand the value of your awaited cruise holiday, to mitigate the consequences of this unforeseeable change in schedule due to force majeure, you can decide to wait for our further update and make your final decision. If this option is not suitable for you, you can decide to cancel your cruise now and be fully refunded. For the refund process please remember that your personal travel agent is available to provide you with all the necessary information to activate the request for a refund due to the cancellation of your cruise voyage. Please know that you will be constantly updated with any decision taken by first evaluating the safety.</p>
